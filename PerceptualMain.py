#This is the main file that excutes inside of the PDM, also where we must imprt aspects of the GUI
#The most important thing is a while loop this should be the foundation of the code and be limited to an int value
#of 3, this is due to us using a three strike system.

#notes: 
#interval of time/turns per minute
#fact you did a turn and quality of turn 
#how smooth the wheel is 

numOfStrikes = 0
while(numOfStrikes <= 3):
    #Run a code to take a data subset and input into a formula to check
    #agaist our standards of safe driving


    #if this code deterims distratced driving we must add this to our
    #num of strikes and display using a GUI.

    #FIXME, this is code to verify the function of the while loop
    print(numOfStrikes)

#The code after the while loop should be the outcomes of using all three strikes
